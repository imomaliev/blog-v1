# Vim | Better way of setting mapping that calls command mode

## Question

I was trying to create mapping that will not be run for `help` filetype but during that I found out how to propperly set mapping that will run function in command mode

## Answer

`<Cmd>`!

> The <Cmd> pseudokey begins a "command mapping", which executes the command directly (without changing modes). Where you might use ":...<CR>" in the {lhs} of a mapping, you can instead use "<Cmd>...<CR>".

```vim
nnoremap <buffer> <C-]> <Cmd>call JumpToTagWithLocationList()<CR>
```

There is `<Cmd>` argument for `:map`. For more info `:h :map-<cmd>`

## What I Learned
