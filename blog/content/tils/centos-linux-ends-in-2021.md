# CentOS Linux project ends in 2021

## Question

I was having problems setting up CentOS 8 and stumbled upon that CentOS 8 ends in 2021 instead of 2029

## Answer

Use CentOS 7 until 2024.

## What I Learned

1. For some internal reason RHEL decided to stop funding CentOS Linux and only fund CentOS Stream.
