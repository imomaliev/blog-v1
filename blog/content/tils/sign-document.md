# How to sign document

## Question

I needed to hand sign few PDFs. Per my friend's suggestion I tried to create signature from photo. To do that I searched some online resources and didn't find one that could convert my photo to signature `png` for free or some opensource solution that I could run locally. Finally I decided to use my touchpad and write one on https://signature.imageonline.co.

## Answer

After I created `png` file with my signature I tried to upload it to `Preview` app and turns out `Preview` can create signatures from photos and as well via touchpad or iPhone out of the box.

## What I Learned

1. Do not forget to ask the right questions
