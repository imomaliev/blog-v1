Per my friend&amp;rsquo;s suggestion I tried to create signature from photo. To do that I searched some online resources and didn&amp;rsquo;t find one that could convert my photo to signature png for free or some opensource solution that I could run locally. Finally I decided to use my touchpad and write one on https://signature.imageonline.co.
Answer After I created png file with my signature I tried to upload it to Preview app and turns out Preview can create signatures from photos and as well via touchpad or iPhone out of the box.</description></item><item><title>Edit Launchctl System Domain Config</title><link>https://blog.imomaliev.com/tils/edit-launchctl-system-domain-config/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 17:45:58 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://blog.imomaliev.com/tils/edit-launchctl-system-domain-config/</guid><description>How to edit launchctl system domain configs Question I messed up my launchctl configs while I was trying to disable FortiClient from starting on startup.
